# Multiversal Unreal Cinematic Unlocker System / M.U.C.U.S / MUCUS
Yes, I made the name this stupid specifically so I could name it mucus.

But this also parodies a special someone's closed source program, Universal Unreal Unlocker, or UUU.

He decided not to go open source, and decided to instead put newer *(actually good)* versions behind a paywall, I can assure you I've pirated those versions.

Anyways, this program that I plan to make will mimic UUU in every single aspect.

**If you couldn't tell already I'm making this simply out of spite.**
